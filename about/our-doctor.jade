                p.as-para Choosing to specialize in Internal Medicine allows physicians to have the broadest role. It is a specialty that is all encompassing and the cornerstone of medical practice. It is continually evolving due to diverse advancements in research. It also allows a doctor to see the entire family, ranging from older children to adults. The American Board of Internal Medicine deals with the administration of internal medicine in this country. The American College of Physicians promotes the continuing of medical education for the internist. The goal of the organization is to enhance the quality and effectiveness of health care by fostering excellence and professionalism in the practice of medicine. Only fully qualified practitioners are eligible to become members of these organizations.

            p "I became a physician in order to make a meaningful contribution to society. It is my desire to make a significant impact on my patients, as well as their families. My goal is to meet not only the physical needs of my patients but their spiritual and emotional needs as well. The community of Walton County is paramount to me. I was welcomed with open arms into such a tight knit community, and my patients have become like an extended family to me. By practicing medicine here, I wish to impact the community with my multicultural experience.
