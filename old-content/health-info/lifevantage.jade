                            p(class="as-para-intro" style={color:'black'}) Protandim activates the body's natural ability to reduce age-related symptoms on the cellular level. Protandim reduces oxidative stress in humans by an average of 40 percent in 30 days. It activates Nrf2 to communicate with your DNA to deliver a biochemical wake-up call to your genes.
                            h5(class="small-header" style={color:'black'}) The Power of Protandim
                            p(class="as-para" style={color:'black'}) Certain foods, especially fruits and vegetables, contain antioxidants. But Protandim will boost your body’s production of antioxidants more effectively by activating the protein Nrf2, telling cells to turn on a network of antioxidant enzymes and protective genes.

                            Oxidative stress, generated through the process of living life (eating, sleeping, breathing, exercising), is inevitable for everyone. But LifeVantage has the solution: Protandim, the Nrf2 Synergizer®, the most important dietary supplement of our time.<br><br>
                            Comprised of natural plant ingredients, Protandim is a patented, science-based formula that has been researched, tested and validated by renowned universities and institutions. It is the only supplement clinically proven to reduce oxidative stress in humans by an average of 40 percent in 30 days.<br><br>
                            Protandim activates Nrf2, which communicates with cells, instructing them to do what they’re already designed to do: up-regulate “survival genes,” genes that enable cells to survive in the face of stress from free radicals and other oxidants, and down-regulate other genes to help the body function at an optimal level.
